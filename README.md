### Project Overview

This project analyzes public alcohol distribution and sales data from Montgomery County, using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for dashboard development. The dataset includes retail, warehouse, and transfer sales of alcoholic and some non-alcoholic beverages, broken down by supplier, product type, and time period.

The goal of this project is to uncover trends in sales volume, supplier performance, and product category demand across different distribution channels.

### Project Questions

1. Which types of alcoholic beverages generate the highest retail sales in Montgomery County, and how have these trends changed over time?

2. Who are the top-performing suppliers by sales volume, and how does their contribution vary by product category? How do the top retail suppliers compare to the top warehouse suppliers?

3. What are the total retail and warehouse sales quantities from 2017-2020? How many products were sold? How do these numbers vary by year?

### Data Sources

The data in this project is sourced from a data.gov publicly available .csv file which contains the alchocol sales and transfers (retail and warehouse) within Montgomery county.

### Data Cleaning and Processing

The data in this project was obtained by exporting .csv files from.... It was then cleaned and standardized using a python script which handled these steps:

- Date formatting and consistency across all sources

- Missing value handling, filtering out incomplete entries

- Column renaming

- Duplicate row removal

- NULL evaluation

After these steps were completed, processed data was then loaded into Microsoft PowerBI

### Dashboards and Visualizations

This project features a series of interactive Power BI dashboards that provide actionable insights across multiple aspects of retail and warehouse sales. The dashboards are designed for clarity, interactivity, and overall sales analysis, with an executive summary page that summarizes the key charts and findings.

Below are screenshots and explanations of each dashboard designed in Power BI to explore different facets of fitness tracking:
